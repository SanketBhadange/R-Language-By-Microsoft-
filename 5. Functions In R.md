When tackling any complex task, it helps to break things down into smaller, manageable parts. For example, if you have a large team meeting, you wouldn't ask everyone to speak at once; instead, you'd structure the meeting into clear, manageable sections where one person presents at a time.

Functions in programming work similarly; they allow you to take a collection of related commands and bundle them neatly into one unit that can be repeated as often as needed.

# What Exactly is a Function?
Think of a function as a recipe: it takes in some ingredients (called parameters), processes them using clear instructions, and returns a finished dish (called a return value).

Why learn about functions? Because they offer several significant benefits:

- Reusable code: Write once and reuse repeatedly—there is no need to rewrite everything from scratch each time.

- Clarity and simplicity: Instead of reading through many lines of complicated code, you call the named function.

- Easier to maintain: If something needs changing, you adjust it once in the function, not in every separate location you've used that code.

Now, let's build up your understanding step by step.

## Creating and Using Functions in R
Imagine your team regularly needs to calculate the growth rate between two values. Rather than repeating the calculation again and again, let's create a simple function in R:

Function Example: Calculating Percentage Growth in R
```R
# Define a function named 'growthRate' to calculate percentage growth
growthRate <- function(previous_value, current_value) {
  rate <- ((current_value - previous_value) / previous_value) * 100
  return(rate)
}
```
Here's what's happening:

- Function name: growthRate is the name we chose, ideally explaining the function's job (clear, descriptive names help make your scripts easy to understand).

- Parameters: Inside the parentheses (previous_value, current_value) are the inputs for our calculation (like ingredients in a recipe). To calculate growth, we need two numbers:

 previous_value: the starting value

 current_value: the new or updated value

- Function body: This is where the actual calculation happens—in this case, the formula for percentage growth: rate <- ((current_value - previous_value) / previous_value) * 100

- Return value: the output of the function, using return().

In the growthRate function, we instruct R to take two values—a starting number (previous_value) and a new number (current_value)—to calculate how much the value has grown from the starting point. R then takes that calculated growth, turns it into an easy-to-understand percentage, and gives that percentage back to us as the result.

Now, when your team needs to calculate the growth rate, it's easy:

Calling the Example Growth Rate Function
```R
result <- growthRate(200, 250)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```
Here, our function takes in 200 as previous_value and 250 as current_value, performs the calculation, and returns 25—the growth rate in percentage terms.

# Handling Parameters and Arguments
Functions require clear guidance. Parameters are placeholders you define when creating the function, representing inputs the function expects.

Arguments are the actual values given to the function when called. Think of parameters as the empty spaces on an attendance sheet, and arguments as the exact information, like names and numbers, you place into those spaces.

Let's look at another example. Suppose you often need to calculate the total cost after taxes, fees, or discounts; the tax is 10% unless stated otherwise. For this, R allows you to specify default parameters:

Function Example: Using Default Parameter Values in R
```R
calculateTotal <- function(amount, tax_rate = 0.10) {
  total <- amount + (amount * tax_rate)
  return(total)
}
```
Here's what's happening:

- Function name: calculateTotal, clearly describing totaling an amount after adding tax.

- Parameters:

amount: the original cost before tax.

tax_rate: the tax percentage, set with a default value of 0.10 (10%), which makes it optional when calling the function.

- Function body: Calculates the cost of tax added to the original amount, and stores the result in the variable named total.

- Return value: Returns the variable total, representing the final amount after applying tax.

Now let's see it in action:

Calling the Function with Default and Specified Parameter Values
```R
total1 <- calculateTotal(100)        # uses default tax_rate 10%
total2 <- calculateTotal(100, 0.15)  # uses specified tax_rate 15%

print(total1)  # Output: 110 
print(total2)  # Output: 115
```
The first call relies on the default, while the second provides a specific argument for the tax rate. Default parameters are helpful for common scenarios, giving you flexibility without compromising convenience.

# Handling the Output (Return Values)
Functions typically end by sending output back—this is a "return value." Using return() indicates which value you want the function to provide as output. If you forget to define a return value, your function may not behave as expected.

For example, this function calculates and prints the square of a number but does not explicitly return a value:

Function Example: Missing Explicit Return Statement in R
```R
squareAndPrint <- function(x) {
  squared <- x * x
  print(squared)  
}
```
Demonstrating Behavior Without Explicit Return Statement
```R
result <- squareAndPrint(5)
# prints 25 on screen
# but the variable "result" will have no stored numerical return value,
# because the function lacks an explicit "return" statement.
```
It's best practice in R to always explicitly return key outputs using return(), even if you're also printing or doing other activities within your function. This habit clarifies intentions and ensures that future readers (including future you!) know exactly what your function provides.

## Practice Question 1 (single choice):

Look at the following lines of code. What will be the output if the calculateTotal function is given below?

Code Block: Calculate Total Function in R with Default and Specified Parameters
```R
calculateTotal <- function(amount, tax_rate = 0.10) {
  total <- amount + (amount * tax_rate)
  return(total)
}

total1 <- calculateTotal(100)
total2 <- calculateTotal(100, 0.15)

print(total1)
print(total2)
```
- A. 110 and 100

- B. 100 and 115

- C. 110 and 115

- D. 150 and 115

Feedback:

- A. 110 and 100- Incorrect. You might have missed that the default tax rate of 10% applies when no rate is specified, adding to the total amount. The tax rate increases the total rather than leaving it the same. Remember, tax is always added to the original amount, so the total will go up.

- B.  100 and 115- Incorrect. This option seems right. If you overlooked that taxes should be added rather than kept the same, it's easy to choose this answer. Remember that applying the tax increases the total, so 100 wouldn’t remain unchanged.

- C.  110 and 115- Correct! Great job! Here's why: when calling calculateTotal(100), the function uses the default tax rate of 10%, which means the formula becomes 100 + (100 * 0.10), resulting in 110. In the second case, calling calculateTotal(100, 0.15), the specified tax rate is 15%, so the formula 100 + (100 * 0.15) results in 115. The function applies these calculations to return the correct totals.

- D. 150 and 115- Incorrect. The confusion might come from seeing the totals as dramatically different. The function adds tax to the amount based on the specified and default rates, so results should reflect more moderate increases by percentage, not drastic jumps.

# Function Documentation—Helping Your Future Self and Team Members
Once you start creating multiple functions, remembering exactly how each works becomes difficult, especially as your code grows. Clear function documentation helps clarify what each function does, the parameters it expects, and the value it returns.

The simplest documentation method is adding a clear comment block just above your function definition:

Function Documentation Example
```R
# Calculates the discounted price of an item.
# Parameters:
#   price: Numeric, original price of the item.
#   discount: Numeric, discount percentage (default is 10%).
# Returns:
#   Numeric, the final price after applying the discount.
calculateDiscountedPrice <- function(price, discount = 0.10) {
  final_price <- price - (price * discount)
  return(final_price)
}
```
This documentation style ensures anyone, your colleagues, team members, or even future you, can quickly understand each function’s intended behavior and use it correctly without confusion.

## Quick Guide to Best Practices and Common Mistakes:
- Keep it simple: Each function should do exactly one thing. Avoid complex, multi-purpose functions.

- Use clear names: Function and parameter names should communicate their purpose immediately.

- Avoid repeating yourself: A well-crafted function solves one specific problem you frequently encounter, minimizing repetitive code.

- Always test your functions: Confirm your functions behave as expected with different input values—including edge cases or unusual scenarios.

- Document each function: People who maintain your code later (and that might well be you!) will be grateful for detailed notes that explain each function fully.

Quick Tip: If you're using GitHub Copilot along with Visual Studio Code while writing your R functions, you might notice Copilot occasionally suggests completions or even full functions as you type. It's a helpful tool for everyday, repetitive tasks, speeding up coding and catching potential mistakes—but always verify its suggestions carefully. Remember, Copilot supports your coding workflow, but the final accuracy and testing remain your responsibility.
